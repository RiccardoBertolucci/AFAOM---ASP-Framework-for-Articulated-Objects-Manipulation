This folder contains all the python scripts we develop to collect data and test our architecture.
Moreover, it includes three other folders that contain results and initial data.

Python 3.7.0 realese is suggested.

## FOLDERS 

### ASP/clingo

It contains:
* Our Knowledgebase
* The ASP encoding we used 
* The solution founded by Clingo from [Potasco](https://potassco.org/)
* The plans we extracted from these solutions
* The files generated by "pyrunlim" script for each experiment. 
  They contain meaningfull data such as the execution time.

### Times output

It contains: 

- The execution time, including computation of a relaible solution, exctraction of the plan and its validation. Theese data were used to fill 
  the tables mentioned above.

### latex_tables

It contains: 
* The source files written in LaTeX for the table containing the perfermances data of our architecture 
* The tables in ".pdf" containing the data we gathered.

## FILES 

### clingo_solver

It calls the "wrapper_clingo" script for each file included in 
the "ASP/clingo/data" folder. 

### clingo_selective solver 

It calls the "wrapper_clingo" script for a user defined subset of the file
included in the "ASP/clingo/data" folder. 

### wrapper clingo

It calls the Clingo solver from [Potasco](https://potassco.org/). This script encrease
the maximum number of step allowed to complete a plan if the
solver is not able to find a solution. It stops if a solution 
is found or if its execution time surpass one hour.

### parser_clingo

It extracts the plan from the solutions finded by Clingo from [Potasco](https://potassco.org/)

### pyrunlim

It generate files containing meaninfull data about an experiemnt such as:
CPU time, user time, memory used and many other. 

### times_collector

It extract the data we need from the pyrunlim generated files.
